## Installation Instructions
>No installation required. However, NPM and Node.js are requirements for this generator to function.

## Usage Information
>Open index.js in your coding terminal. Run `npm install`. Run `node index`. You will be prompted with a series of questions. The license input has multiple options, which you will need to use your up and down arrow keys to scroll, and your spacebar for selection.
